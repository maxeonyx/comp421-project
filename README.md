# Generative Model Regularization for Feature Visualization by Optimisation

An implementation of the ideas introduced in "Synthesizing the preferred inputs for neurons in neural networks via deep generator networks" https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.09304.pdf

The first file you should open is `notebook.ipynb`, it is viewable through GitHub, but here is a [Google Colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/maxeonyx/comp421-project/blob/master/notebook.ipynb). The notebook won't run, because it depends on other python files and saved models, but it has images and details not contained in the report.
